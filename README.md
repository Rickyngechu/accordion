## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive web design.
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about buliding accordion sections with javascript.

```js
el.forEach((el) =>
  el.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
    e.target.classList.toggle("add");
  })
);
```

### Continued development

I will continue perfecting my css and html skills moreso creating custom buttons,checkboxes and being able to manipulate them.However since the challenge had an added advantage of one being able to accomplish the task without using js,that is the next challenge.

### Useful resources
