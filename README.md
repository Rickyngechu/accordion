## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive web design.
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about buliding accordion sections with javascript.

```js
el.forEach((el) =>
  el.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
    e.target.classList.toggle("add");
  })
);
```

### Continued development

I will continue perfecting my css and html skills moreso creating custom buttons,checkboxes and being able to manipulate them.However since the challenge had an added advantage of one being able to accomplish the task without using js,that is the next challenge.

### Useful resources

- [Tools](Jonas.io/resources) - This helped me for color and web testing tools. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

- [Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) - This is mozzila developer network for web developer documentation of html css and js.
